    <p class="has-text-light">
      I started playing Granblue Fantasy after a good friend I met through Dungeon Defenders 2 (PureChocolateThunder) introduced me to the game on March 3rd, 2018. I would grind the game on and off until I joined Mentha, sister crew to Mint, on August 18th, 2019. It was here where I was inspired by Mentha's First Officer, Tanuki, to create a spark bot for Discord. Tanuki missed using Zooey bot (made by Akeyro) to keep track of their sparks, as Zooey bot was dead at the time. I already had a decent amount of experience developing a Discord bot (<a class="has-text-link" href="https://cryotalis.github.io/Protobot/">Protobot</a>, for Dungeon Defenders 2), and when I brought up that I could make a replacement, they fully encouraged me to do it, and Europa bot was created. (Fun fact: the congratulatory message sent when you save up a spark was fully inspired by Tanuki, and they gave me the emotes to use too). Europa was chosen as the mascot because the leader of Mint (Byundai) asked me to name it either Europa or Grimnir, and obviously, Europa is better :)

      I would continue to improve the spark command here and there until I got the idea to use an image for the spark command instead a few weeks later. I copied the formatting and look of the in-game Stats card (on the home page) and rearranged the assets to make the spark profile card. I thought it looked awesome, and my crewmmates did too. A week later, I would make my first public post about Europa on the GBF subreddit. Within a day, 30 servers had added her, and within 1.5 months, she reached 100 servers.

      A few more weeks later, I developed the player and crew commands, and posted another update to reddit. It was at this point where Europa truly blew up. 2 days after my post, over 100 servers added her, and she had reached an additional 100 servers within a week. Within a month of the update, she had been added to an additional 400 servers in total. This explosive growth would continue well into 2020, but would eventually slow down as 2021 rolled around. Today, she is used in a little over 2000 servers.
