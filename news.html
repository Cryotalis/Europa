<h1>Changes and Improvements<hr></h1>
<strong>$Spark</strong>
<ul>
    <li>You can now set all your spark resources with one command! See the command list for more information.</li>
    <ul><li>Thanks to Alvin for suggesting this.</li></ul>
    <li>$spark add/subtract/set now tells you how many total draws you have after adding to/subtracting from/setting your spark resources.</li>
    <li>If you have over 100% progress towards a spark, the portion of the progress bar that would overflow is now layered on top and<br>colored red instead (just like GBF characters who have 200% charge bar limit).</li>
    <ul><li>Thanks to Dopemeister for suggesting this.</li></ul>
    <li>Added support for Japanese characters, as well as many other characters to be displayed in the spark profile.</li>
    <ul><li>Thanks to マムクート for bringing this up to me.</li></ul>
</ul>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Added a sky blue gradient background to Europa's profile picture.</li>
    <li>Made massive improvements to this website.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Bug Fixes<hr></h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug affecting roughly 1% of users that prevented them from successfully creating a spark profile and tracking their sparks.</li>
    <ul><li>Thanks to Kish for helping me resolve this issue.</li></ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug that would cause duplicate server profiles to be created for the greeting feature if Europa was kicked and<br>re-invited to a server. I'm unsure as to whether this has actually affected anyone.</li>
</ul>
