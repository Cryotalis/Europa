<h2>Q: When will my suggestion be implemented?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <strike>I'll add it when I feel like it.</strike> When something will be added depends on several things. First, I have to actually accept your suggestion. If I don't deem your suggestion as an improvement to the bot, I probably won't add it. If I accept your suggestion, I will put it in the #europa-to-do-list channel in my discord server, and I'll work on it. Depending on how busy I am and how helpful I think this suggestion is, the suggestion should be incorporated within 1~2 months.</p>
<br>
<h2>Q: What will you be adding to Europa in the future?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm thinking about allowing users to add a custom background to their spark profiles. I'm also considering adding commands that Vampy Bot has, as I've been told that its creators do not work on it anymore, and it also has no publicly available invite link. I'm also considering allowing users to set a custom prefix for Europa, as opposed to "$ for regular commands and "=" for mod commands. If you think any of these features would be nice, let me know via the $feedback command.</p>

<p>More questions/answers will be added as they come in.</p>
