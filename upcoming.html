<br>
<h1>What's Next? (Future Plans)<hr></h1>
<i style="font-size: small;">All of these are simply plans and ideas. While most of these ideas will probably be implemented, none of them are guaranteed to be added.</i>
<h3>Commands</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some kind of gacha command, similar to AcePictureBot's.</li>
  <li>A reminder command, to remind you about striketimes or whatever you want.</li>
  <li>A sticker command, for using emotes. (I'll have to go get permission from people and I'm not very sure where to start)</li>
  <li>A "friends" command, for generating an image with support summons, so you can find friends :o.</li>
  <ul><li>I've noticed people using the screenshot generated by $player to recruit friends, this might make things easier.</li></ul>
  <li>A guides command, for pulling up useful guides for Granblue Fantasy.</li>
  <li>A news command, for checking the most recent news. (News from the offical GBF news page probably)</li>
  <li>A character/summon search commmand, which can display information about a character or a summon. (Maybe even include weapons?)</li>
  <li>Ability to set custom prefixes through a =prefix command.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Further improve this website and improve existing commands.</li>
  <li>Add shortcuts for commands where possible</li>
  <ul><li>$spark background => $spark bg</li></ul>
  <ul><li>$bugreport => $bug</li></ul>
  <ul><li>$spark set X crystals, Y tickets, Z 10parts => $spark set X, Y, Z</li></ul>
  <li>Make the nickname auto-updater change all nicknames across all servers, if the nicknames are the same and if this is possible.</li>
  <li>A blue colored progress bar if someone has over 200% spark progress</li>
  <li>Merge $addrole and $removerole into one command, $role. This command would remove the role if you already have it, and add the role if you didn't already have it.</li>
  <li>Change Europa's status to show number of spark profiles in the database rather than the total number of users between all guilds Europa is in.</li>
  <li>Improve error messages for incorrect usage of commands.</li>
  <li>Allow Administrators to switch Europa to use another language, such as Japanese or Chinese.</li>
  <ul><li>This one's a bit ambitious and will probably not happen unless I can get people to translate for me.</li></ul>
</ul>
<h3>Open Source!</h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px;">Europa will go open source after update V3, which should happen some time in Fall 2020 or Winter 2020. This will take some effort, but I believe<br>this will be quite beneficial for others looking to create Granblue Fantasy Discord bots or just Discord bots in general. If I end up stopping<br>development of Europa, I want to make sure others can still host her on their own and make changes as they see fit. I will have to decide whether<br> I want to allow others to be able to contribute to the offical build. <br><br>Side note: Because her database is actually a Google Spreadsheet, it may be a little difficult for others to host her on their own.</p>
